        <p>Welcome to my homepage. Here is a little bit of information about me as a person. 
        I am a fifth year Computing Science student finishing up my Bachelors of Science with a 
        Computing Science specialization in Software Practice. During my time on campus I have been heavily
        involved with campus events including Week of Welcome, Campus Cup and Antifreeze.

        I have been involved with Week of Welcome for 4 years where I was a general volunteer for two years. Here my responsibilty was to
        welcome new students to campus, lead a tour for the students and answer any questions that they had about campus. For the other two years I
        have been a senior volunteer that had to work with a team of 60 other senior volunteers to recruit applicants, interview and build our team of volunteers that
        will welcome new students to campus. Within this role we also are in charge of training our volunteers to make sure that they have the necessary skills
        to provide an excellent experience for new students.
